### Core Components & Responsibilities

1.  **Next.js Application (`src/app/`, `src/components/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/`)**
    *   **Frontend Rendering:** Manages all client-side and server-side rendering using the App Router. Responsible for displaying the UI, handling navigation, and providing interactive elements.
    *   **Data Fetching:** Initiates requests to the Elysia.js API or Sanity.io CDN for dynamic content. Utilizes React Server Components (RSC) and SWR caching for efficient data management.
    *   **UI/UX:** Integrates Tailwind CSS, `shadcn/ui`, and custom MagicUI components for a polished, responsive, and animated user interface.
    *   **PWA & SEO:** Handles manifest, service worker registration, sitemap, robots.txt, and Open Graph meta tags.

2.  **Elysia.js API Gateway (`src/app/api/[[...route]]/elysia.ts`, `src/app/api/v1/[[...route]]/elysia.ts`)**
    *   **Centralized Backend:** A lightweight, high-performance API backend built with [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/), designed to run efficiently on Edge functions.
    *   **External Integrations:** Acts as a proxy and aggregator for various external APIs (Spotify, GitHub, Wakatime, Lanyard, Hashnode), abstracting their complexities and providing a unified interface.
    *   **Guestbook Management:** Handles guestbook message submission, storage (Firebase), and retrieval.
    *   **Security Layer:** Implements CSRF protection, rate limiting, and an IP banlist to secure API endpoints.
    *   **Data Caching:** Leverages Redis for caching frequently accessed data from external APIs to reduce load and improve response times.

3.  **Sanity.io CMS (`sanity.config.ts`, `src/sanity/`)**
    *   **Headless Content Management:** Provides a flexible content management system for structured data such as projects, experiences, certifications, and resume details.
    *   **Content API:** Offers a GraphQL API (or GROQ query language) to fetch content, which Next.js consumes.
    *   **Sanity Studio:** A customizable UI for content editors to manage and publish content.

4.  **Firebase (`src/core/firebase.ts`, `src/core/firebase-admin.ts`)**
    *   **Authentication:** Manages user authentication for interactive features like the guestbook.
    *   **Firestore:** Used as a NoSQL database for storing dynamic user-generated content, specifically guestbook messages.

5.  **Redis (`src/classes/redis.ts`)**
    *   **Distributed Cache:** Utilized by the Elysia.js API to cache responses from external services, minimizing repeated API calls and improving performance.

</details>

#### Sanity.io Setup

1.  **Create a Sanity project:**
    If you don't have one, navigate to the `sanity` directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd sanity
    sanity init
    # Follow the prompts: create new project, choose "Blog" or "Empty project" and then migrate schemas.
    # Select a dataset name (e.g., 'production').
    # Deploy your studio when prompted (this makes it accessible online).
    ```

2.  **Deploy Sanity schemas:**
    From the `sanity` directory:

    ```bash
    sanity deploy
    # This ensures your studio has the correct schema definitions from src/sanity/schemaTypes
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables for Sanity:**
    Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` in `.env.local` with the values from your Sanity project.
    Create a "Read Token" in your Sanity project settings ([manage.sanity.io](https://manage.sanity.io/)), and set it as `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.

4.  **Import initial data:**
    You'll need to populate your Sanity studio with content (projects, experiences, etc.) either manually or via a Sanity import script if you have existing data.

#### Firebase Setup

1.  **Create a Firebase project:**
    Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2.  **Enable Authentication:**
    In your Firebase project, navigate to "Authentication" and enable the desired sign-in methods (e.g., Google, Email/Password).

3.  **Set up Firestore:**
    In your Firebase project, navigate to "Firestore Database" and create a new database.
    Set up security rules to allow authenticated users to read and write to a `messages` collection. A basic rule for testing might be:

    ```
    rules_version = '2';
    service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /messages/{messageId} {
          allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Configure Firebase environment variables:**
    *   **Client-side (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_...`):** In your Firebase project settings, add a new web app and copy its configuration to your `.env.local` file.
    *   **Server-side (`FIREBASE_...`):** For Firebase Admin SDK, go to "Project settings" -> "Service accounts" -> "Generate new private key." Download the JSON file. Extract the `private_key`, `private_key_id`, `client_email`, `client_id`, `auth_uri`, `token_uri`, `auth_provider_x509_cert_url`, `client_x509_cert_url`, and `universe_domain` into your `.env.local`. Ensure `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` has `\n` replaced with actual newlines if base64 encoded.

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

To run the Next.js application in development mode with hot-reloading:

1.  Start the Next.js development server:

    ```bash
    bun dev
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

2.  (Optional) Start the Sanity Studio if you need to manage content locally:
    In a separate terminal, navigate to the `sanity` directory and run:

    ```bash
    cd sanity
    bun sanity start
    ```

    The Sanity Studio will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:3333`.

#### Production Build & Run

To build the application for production and run it:

1.  **Build the Next.js application:**

    ```bash
    bun build
    ```

2.  **Start the production server:**

    ```bash
    bun start
    ```

    The application will run in production mode, typically on port `3000`.

#### Running with Docker

The project includes Docker support for containerized deployment.

1.  **Build the Docker image:**

    ```bash
    docker compose build
    ```

2.  **Run the Docker container:**

    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. If you need to stop it, use `docker compose down`.

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Using Docker for Sanity Studio & Redis (Advanced)</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>

The `docker-compose.yml` also includes a Redis service for local caching and can be extended to include a Sanity Studio service if desired, though Sanity Studio is often run locally via CLI or deployed.

To include Redis in your local development environment:
1. Ensure `REDIS_URL="redis://redis:6379"` is set in your `.env.local` if you're running the app in Docker, or `redis://localhost:6379` if running Next.js locally and Redis in Docker.
2. Run `docker compose up -d redis` to start just the Redis service in the background.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap <a name="limitations"></a>

[[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#Ô∏è-table-of-contents)]

### Current Limitations

*   **External API Rate Limits:** Reliance on free tiers of external APIs (Spotify, GitHub, Wakatime) may lead to occasional rate limiting, especially with high traffic. Caching is implemented to mitigate this, but persistent high load could still be an issue.
*   **Sanity.io Dependency:** The core content of the portfolio (projects, experience, certifications) is entirely dependent on Sanity.io. Without a configured Sanity project, these sections will be empty.
*   **Guestbook Authentication:** Currently, only Google authentication is readily configured for the guestbook. Extending to other providers (GitHub, Email/Password) would require additional Firebase setup.
*   **Offline Functionality:** While PWA is enabled, complex dynamic content (real-time stats, guestbook interaction) naturally requires an internet connection. Static content will be cached.

### Known Issues

*   **Initial Load Latency for Real-time Data:** On the first load, some external API calls might introduce a slight delay before data such as Spotify or Wakatime stats fully populate, as they hit cold caches. This is minimized with server-side caching and streaming.
*   **Potential for Stale Data:** Although caching is implemented, in rare cases, extremely recent updates to external services (e.g., a Spotify song just changed) might not reflect immediately due to cache TTL (Time-To-Live).

### Future Roadmap

The following enhancements and features are planned or under consideration:

*   **More API Integrations:** Explore integrating more developer-centric platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, or Dev.to for additional profile insights.
*   **Advanced Blog Features:** Implement full-text search for blog posts, categories, tags, and potentially an integrated commenting system.
*   **AI-Powered Features:** Explore integrating AI for content generation suggestions within the Sanity Studio or for personalized content recommendations.
*   **Enhanced Interactivity:**
    *   Interactive globe for "Places I've visited."
    *   More sophisticated animations and micro-interactions.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** A basic admin panel to manage guestbook messages, IP bans, and cache invalidation without direct database access.
*   **Improved Error Reporting:** Integrate with a service like Sentry or LogRocket for more granular error monitoring and session replays.
*   **Performance Optimizations:** Continuous efforts to reduce bundle size, optimize image loading, and improve server response times.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Support for multiple languages to broaden audience reach.
*   **Webhooks for Sanity:** Implement webhooks to trigger automatic revalidation of Next.js pages when Sanity content is updated, ensuring faster content updates without manual redeployment.

    *   You should see a prompt to open a pull request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Provide a detailed description of your changes, including why they are necessary and how they were implemented.
    *   Reference any relevant issues.

### Branching & Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Branch Naming:** Use `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `chore/` prefixes (e.g., `feat/implement-new-api`).
*   **Commit Messages:** Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.
*   **Pull Request Description:** Clearly explain the purpose of the PR, the changes made, and any potential side effects. Include screenshots or GIFs for UI changes.
*   **Code Review:** All PRs require at least one approval before merging. Be responsive to feedback.

### Code Style & Linting

We use a combination of Biome, ESLint, and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style.
*   **Biome:** Used for overall project formatting and linting (`biome.json`).
*   **ESLint:** Specific rules for React, Next.js, and TypeScript (`.eslintrc.json`).
*   **Prettier:** For final code formatting (`.prettierrc.json`).

Ensure your code adheres to these standards by running:

```bash
bun lint:fix
bun format
```

### Testing

*   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Located in `src/__tests__/` and run using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
    ```bash
    bun test
    ```
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Located in `src/e2e/` and run using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).
    ```bash
    bun test:e2e
    ```
    These tests require the application to be running (e.g., via `bun dev` or `bun start`) or a `bun build` before `bun test:e2e`.

### Development Setup

For a full local development setup, you'll want to run:

1.  **Application:** `bun dev`
2.  **Sanity Studio:** `cd sanity && bun sanity start` (in a separate terminal)
3.  **Firebase Emulators:** (Optional, for advanced local Firebase development) `firebase emulators:start`

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) <a name="faq"></a>

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Q: How do I update my portfolio content?</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>
<br>
A: All static content (projects, experiences, certifications, blog settings) is managed through Sanity.io. Access your Sanity Studio (e.g., `https://your-project-id.sanity.studio/`) to make changes. Once changes are published, the Next.js application will fetch the updated content. For immediate revalidation on Vercel, consider setting up Sanity webhooks.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Q: Can I self-host this application?</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>
<br>
A: Yes! The application is designed to be highly portable. You can use the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to deploy it on any platform that supports Docker containers (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, a private VPS). Remember to configure all environment variables correctly for your hosting environment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Q: My real-time stats (Spotify, Wakatime) aren't showing up. What should I check?</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>
<br>
A:
1.  **Environment Variables:** Double-check that all `SPOTIFY_`, `WAKATIME_`, `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `LANYARD_USER_ID` environment variables are correctly set in your `.env.local` file.
2.  **API Keys/Tokens:** Ensure your Spotify refresh token, Wakatime API key, and GitHub access token are valid and have the necessary permissions. Spotify refresh tokens can expire, requiring re-generation.
3.  **Internet Connection:** Confirm that the server running the application has outbound internet access to reach these external APIs.
4.  **Rate Limits:** If you're frequently hitting these APIs, you might be temporarily rate-limited. Wait a bit and try again. Caching is in place to minimize this.
5.  **Elysia.js API:** Verify that the Elysia.js API routes (e.g., `/api/v1/now-playing`) are responding correctly. You can try accessing them directly in your browser or with `curl` if running locally.
</details>

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Q: How do I clear the local cache?</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>
<br>
A: If you're using Redis for caching, you can clear its data by restarting the Redis service or by using a Redis client to `FLUSHDB` or `FLUSHALL`. For the Next.js build cache, running `bun cleanup` will remove `.next/` and other temporary build artifacts.
</details>

### Troubleshooting Guide <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

<details>
<summary>
  <strong>Common Issues & Solutions</strong> (Click to expand)
</summary>

*   **`Error: bun command not found`**: Ensure Bun is installed correctly and its binary is in your system's PATH. If not using Bun, switch to `npm` or `yarn` commands.
*   **`Error: Environment variables missing`**: Review the [Configuration](#configuration) section and ensure all required variables in `.env.local` are set. Pay special attention to complex variables like `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`.
*   **`Sanity Studio not loading/schemas outdated`**:
    1.  Navigate to the `sanity` directory.
    2.  Run `sanity deploy` to push your local schemas to your Sanity project.
    3.  Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET` in `.env.local` match your Sanity project settings.
*   **`API routes returning 401/403 errors`**:
    1.  Check the `API_SECRET_KEY` in `.env.local` for consistency between client and server/API.
    2.  Verify Firebase authentication setup and rules for the guestbook.
    3.  Ensure `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` is correctly set if you are querying private Sanity content on the server.
    4.  Check the API gateway's logs for more specific error messages (e.g., rate limit exceeded, IP banned).
*   **`Playwright tests failing on fresh install`**: Ensure you have run `bun install` to install Playwright browsers. If not, try `bun playwright install`. Also, ensure the application is running (`bun dev` or `bun start`) before running `bun test:e2e`.
*   **Slow Development Server**: Try deleting the `.next` and `node_modules` (or `bun.lockb`) directories and reinstalling dependencies. `bun cleanup` helps.
</details>

### API Reference <a name="api-reference-1"></a>

The Elysia.js API endpoints are self-documented using Swagger/OpenAPI.

To view the interactive API documentation:

1.  Start the Next.js development server (which also runs the Elysia API via Next.js API routes): `bun dev`
2.  Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:3000/api/swagger` (or `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/swagger` for v1 APIs).

This will display the Swagger UI, allowing you to explore all available endpoints, their expected parameters, and response schemas.
