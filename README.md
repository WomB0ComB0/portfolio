### 4. Bundle Analysis Workflow
- **Purpose**: To analyze and report the bundle size of the application.
- **Trigger**: Runs on push and pull requests to the master branch.
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout the repository.
  - Setup Bun.
  - Install dependencies.
  - Build the application.
  - Analyze the bundle size.
  - Upload analysis results and compare with the base branch.

### 5. CodeQL Security Analysis Workflow
- **Purpose**: To perform security analysis on the codebase using CodeQL.
- **Trigger**: Runs on push and pull requests to the master branch, and on a schedule.
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout the repository.
  - Initialize CodeQL.
  - Perform CodeQL analysis.

### 6. Release Workflow
- **Purpose**: To automate the release process using Semantic Release.
- **Trigger**: Manually triggered or on push to the master branch.
- **Steps**:
  - Checkout the repository.
  - Run Semantic Release to create and publish a new release.

## Installation Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Bun installed, then run:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Setup Secrets**
   Set up the necessary environment variables in your GitHub repository settings under "Secrets". This includes API keys and configuration settings used in the workflows.

## Usage Instructions
- **Trigger Workflows**: Workflows are automatically triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `master` branch. You can also manually trigger the release workflow.
- **Linting**: The code will be automatically linted on every push or pull request.
- **Testing**: Unit tests will run automatically after the code is built.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Playwright tests will run after the application is built.
- **Bundle Analysis**: The bundle size will be analyzed and reported after every push or pull request.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a comprehensive CI/CD setup for maintaining code quality and security through automated workflows. Follow the installation and usage instructions to leverage the full capabilities of the project.# Project Title
