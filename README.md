# Project Name

## Overview

This project consists of a set of GitHub Actions workflows designed to facilitate linting, testing, and CodeQL analysis for a JavaScript-based application. The workflows are structured to run on pushes and pull requests to the master branch, ensuring that code quality is maintained throughout the development process.

## Major Components

1. **Linting Workflow** (`Lint`):
   - Automatically checks code for linting issues when changes are pushed or pull requests are made.
   - Uses Bun for dependency management and running linting scripts.
   - Includes steps for checking the Dockerfile using Hadolint.

2. **Testing Workflow** (`Testing`):
   - Executes unit tests whenever changes are made to the `master` branch or pull requests are created.
   - Builds the application and runs tests using Bun.
   - Enforces a production environment for testing.

3. **Playwright Tests Workflow** (`Playwright Tests`):
   - Runs end-to-end tests using Playwright when changes are made.
   - Sets up the application, installs browsers, and generates reports on test results.

4. **Next.js Bundle Analysis Workflow** (`Next.js Bundle Analysis`):
   - Analyzes the size of the application bundles and compares them against previous builds.
   - Generates a report for developers to review and optimize the application size.

5. **CodeQL Analysis Workflow** (`CodeQL`):
   - Automatically analyzes the code for security vulnerabilities and coding errors.
   - Runs on a schedule and on code pushes/pull requests to ensure ongoing security reviews.

6. **Release Workflow** (`Release`):
   - Facilitates semantic versioning and release management for the project.
   - Triggered manually or on pushes to the master branch.
