```

### Core Components & Responsibilities

1.  **Next.js Frontend (Vercel)**:
    *   **Server Components (`src/app/**/page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`):** Handle data fetching, SEO metadata generation, and initial page rendering on the server for performance and searchability. They act as orchestration layers, fetching data from the Elysia.js API or Sanity.
    *   **Client Components (`'use client'`):** Provide interactivity (e.g., guestbook input, theme toggles, animations), manage client-side state, and handle user events.
    *   **App Router:** Organizes routing, layouts, and data fetching in a modern React paradigm.
    *   **Providers (`src/providers`):** Centralized React Context providers for themes, data fetching (TanStack Query), global state (Jotai, Zustand), and other services.

2.  **Elysia.js Backend API (Vercel Serverless)**:
    *   Located at `src/app/api/[[...route]]/elysia.ts` and `src/app/api/v1/[[...route]]/elysia.ts`.
    *   A lightweight, high-performance API layer built with [Elysia.js](https://elysiajs.com/), a Bun-based framework.
    *   **API Gateway:** Aggregates data from various external APIs (Spotify, GitHub, Hashnode, Lanyard, Wakatime) and serves it to the Next.js frontend.
    *   **Custom Logic:** Handles operations like guestbook message submission, security middleware (CSRF, Rate Limiting, IP bans), and data transformation.
    *   **Caching (`src/classes/redis.ts`, `src/classes/swr-cache.ts`):** Implements server-side caching using Redis to reduce API calls and improve response times for frequently requested data.

3.  **Sanity.io CMS**:
    *   A headless content management system used for structured content like projects, work experiences, and certifications.
    *   The Next.js frontend fetches data from Sanity via the Elysia.js API or directly using Sanity client in server components.
    *   Provides a dedicated studio for content editors (`sanity.config.ts`).

4.  **Firebase (Authentication & Firestore)**:
    *   **Firebase Authentication:** Powers user login (e.g., Google, GitHub) for interactive features like the guestbook.
    *   **Firestore Database:** Stores dynamic user-generated content, such as guestbook messages. Real-time updates are handled using Jotai atoms.

5.  **External APIs**:
    *   **Spotify:** Fetches "Now Playing" status, top artists, and top tracks.
    *   **GitHub:** Retrieves pinned repositories and profile statistics.
    *   **Hashnode:** Integrates with a personal blog to display recent posts.
    *   **Lanyard:** Connects to Discord to show real-time user activity and status.
    *   **Wakatime:** Provides coding activity metrics and statistics.

6.  **Monitoring & Analytics**:
    *   **OpenTelemetry & Sentry:** For distributed tracing, error reporting, and performance monitoring across the application.

## ⚠️ Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap <a name="limitations"></a>
[[⬆️ Back to Top](#️-table-of-contents)]

### Current Limitations <a name="current-limitations"></a>
*   **External API Dependencies:** Heavy reliance on external APIs means downtime or rate limits from providers (Spotify, GitHub, etc.) can affect certain features. Caching is implemented to mitigate this but isn't foolproof.
*   **Cold Start:** Serverless functions for the Elysia.js API might experience cold starts, leading to slight delays on the first request after a period of inactivity.
*   **Complex Setup:** The multi-service architecture (Next.js, Elysia, Sanity, Firebase, Redis) can make the initial setup slightly complex for new contributors.
*   **Effect Integration:** The use of the `Effect` functional programming library in the API might have a steeper learning curve for developers unfamiliar with it.

### Known Issues <a name="known-issues"></a>
*   **Sporadic API Rate Limits:** Occasionally, intensive usage or rapid refreshes might hit rate limits on third-party APIs (especially GitHub), causing temporary data unavailability.
*   **Sanity Content Sync Delay:** Changes made in Sanity Studio might take a few seconds to reflect on the live site due to caching mechanisms.
*   **Liveblocks Issues:** (If enabled) Real-time cursor presence might occasionally disconnect in unstable network conditions.

### Future Roadmap <a name="roadmap"></a>
The project is continuously evolving. Here are some planned enhancements:
*   **Enhanced Interactivity:** More real-time components using Liveblocks or WebSockets, like collaborative editing for certain content sections (if applicable).
*   **Additional API Integrations:** Explore integrating with more services (e.g., Stack Overflow, LinkedIn activity feed).
*   **Improved Caching Strategies:** Implement more advanced edge caching with Vercel KV for global performance.
*   **Full Internationalization (i18n):** Support for multiple languages to broaden the audience.
*   **Refined UI/UX:** Continuous improvements to design, accessibility, and user flow based on feedback and analytics.
*   **Stripe Integration:** For potential e-commerce functionalities (e.g., "Hire Me" services, digital product sales).
*   **Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard:** A dedicated, password-protected page to view site analytics.
*   **Automated Content Updates:** Explore webhooks or cron jobs to trigger content updates from external sources (e.g., a new Hashnode post automatically appearing).

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) <a name="faq"></a>

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I update the content on my portfolio?</summary>
A: Content like projects, experiences, and certifications are managed through <a href="#sanity-setup">Sanity.io CMS</a>. After setting up your Sanity project, you can access the Sanity Studio (usually at `/studio` on your domain or locally via `bun run sanity start`) to make edits. Blog posts are managed directly on your Hashnode account.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: Can I use this template for my own portfolio?</summary>
A: Yes! This project is open-source under the <a href="#license">MIT License</a>. You are encouraged to fork it, adapt it, and make it your own. Remember to update the `.env` variables with your personal API keys and content sources.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: How do I deploy this application?</summary>
A: The recommended deployment platform is <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>, as the project is optimized for it (Next.js, serverless functions). You can link your GitHub repository to Vercel, and it will automatically build and deploy your application on every push to the `main` branch. Ensure all <a href="#env-vars">environment variables</a> are configured in your Vercel project settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Q: What if a specific feature (e.g., Spotify Now Playing) isn't working?</summary>
A:
1.  **Check `.env`:** Double-check that all relevant environment variables (e.g., `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`) are correctly configured and valid.
2.  **API Status:** Verify that the third-party API (e.g., Spotify API) is operational and not experiencing downtime.
3.  **Logs:** Check your local server logs (in development mode) or Vercel deployment logs for any error messages related to API calls.
4.  **Rate Limits:** You might have hit a rate limit. Wait a few minutes and try again.
</details>

### Troubleshooting Guide <a name="troubleshooting"></a>

<details>
<summary>❌ "Error: missing environment variables"</summary>
**Cause:** The application failed to start because one or more critical environment variables are not set in your `.env` file or deployment environment.
**Solution:** Refer to the <a href="#env-vars">Configuration section</a> and ensure all required variables are present and correctly populated. If deploying to Vercel, ensure these are added as environment variables in your Vercel project settings.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❌ "API Call Failed" or "Data Not Loading"</summary>
**Cause:** This could be due to incorrect API keys, expired tokens, network issues, or a third-party API being down.
**Solution:**
1.  **Verify API Keys/Tokens:** Double-check all `_KEY`, `_ID`, `_SECRET`, and `_TOKEN` variables in your `.env` for correctness. For refresh tokens (e.g., Spotify), ensure they are still valid.
2.  **Check Network:** Confirm your internet connection is stable.
3.  **Inspect Logs:** Look at the server console (local `bun dev`) or Vercel logs for specific error messages from the Elysia.js API or external services.
4.  **Test External APIs:** You can sometimes test external API endpoints directly using tools like Postman or `curl` to isolate the issue.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❌ "Sanity Studio Not Loading" or "Sanity Content Not Appearing"</summary>
**Cause:** Issues with Sanity project configuration, network, or schema deployment.
**Solution:**
1.  **Check Sanity `.env`:** Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET`, and `SANITY_API_READ_TOKEN` are correct.
2.  **Run Sanity Studio Locally:** Try `bun run sanity start` in your project root to see if the studio itself can connect.
3.  **Deploy Schemas:** If you've made changes to `src/sanity/schemaTypes/` or if it's a new setup, ensure you've deployed your schemas using `bun run sanity deploy`.
</details>

<details>
<summary>❌ "Guestbook Authentication Not Working"</summary>
**Cause:** Incorrect Firebase configuration or issues with Firebase project setup.
**Solution:**
1.  **Firebase `.env`:** Confirm all `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_...` variables are accurately copied from your Firebase project settings.
2.  **Firebase Console:**
    *   Ensure **Firebase Authentication** is enabled in your Firebase project.
    *   Verify that the specific sign-in providers (e.g., Google, GitHub) you intend to use are **enabled** in the Firebase Authentication settings.
    *   Check your **Firestore Database** rules to ensure your application has permission to read and write messages.
</details>

### API Reference <a name="api-reference"></a>
The application exposes several API endpoints via the Elysia.js backend. These are primarily for internal use by the Next.js frontend, but can be explored for custom integrations.

The main API routes are located under:
*   `/api/[[...route]]`: For general-purpose API routes.
*   `/api/v1/[[...route]]`: For versioned API endpoints.

**Key Endpoints (Examples):**
*   `/api/v1/blog`: Fetches blog posts from Hashnode.
*   `/api/v1/github-stats`: Retrieves GitHub user statistics.
*   `/api/v1/lanyard`: Gets Discord presence data.
*   `/api/v1/messages`: Handles guestbook messages (read/write, requires authentication for write).
*   `/api/v1/now-playing`: Fetches current Spotify song.
*   `/api/v1/top-artists`: Gets top Spotify artists.
*   `/api/v1/top-tracks`: Gets top Spotify tracks.
*   `/api/v1/wakatime`: Retrieves Wakatime coding activity.

For detailed schema and handler information, refer to the files within `src/app/api/` and `src/app/api/v1/`. Each endpoint typically has associated `handlers.ts` and `schema.ts` files.
