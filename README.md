The primary purpose of this project is to provide high-quality vector graphics and font files that can be used in various applications, including web and print media.

## Major Parts of the Code

1. **SVG Files**: 
   - The project contains multiple SVG files, which are vector graphics that can be scaled without loss of quality. These files can be used for various purposes, such as icons, illustrations, and more.
   - Each SVG file is defined with its width, height, viewbox, and styles that dictate its appearance.

2. **Font Software**:
   - The project includes font software that is licensed under the SIL Open Font License. This allows users to use, modify, redistribute, and sell the fonts as part of other software, provided they adhere to the license conditions.

## Installation Instructions

To use the SVG files and font software in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository.git
   cd repository
   ```

2. **Access SVG Files**:
   - The SVG files are located in the repository's root directory. You can directly use these files in your HTML or web application.

3. **Using the Font Software**:
   - The font files are included in the project. You can install the font by copying the font files to your system's font directory or including them in your project's assets.
   - To use the font in your CSS, add the following rule:
