# Project Name

## Overview
This project is a web application built with Next.js that includes various features such as Firebase integration, a guestbook component, a blog, a statistics dashboard, and Google Maps functionality. It leverages modern technologies and libraries like React, Tailwind CSS, and various GitHub actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Major Components
1. **Guestbook**: Users can leave messages in the guestbook, which is powered by a serverless API to manage message storage.
2. **Blog**: A section for displaying blog posts fetched from an external API.
3. **Statistics Dashboard**: Displays personal statistics, including hours coded and site views.
4. **Google Maps Integration**: Shows locations that the user has visited, with marker clustering for better visualization.
5. **Firebase Authentication**: Allows users to sign in using various methods (Google, GitHub, anonymous).
6. **Playwright Tests**: Automated tests to ensure the application functions as expected.
7. **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Includes workflows for linting, testing, and deploying the application.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A Firebase account and project set up with the necessary configurations.

### Steps

   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
