Here is a to-do list based on the information you provided:

### **Correctness, Performance, and Maintainability**

*   **Prefetching:**
    *   Rely primarily on Next.js's `<Link />` for prefetching.
    *   Use Speculation Rules sparingly for explicit, high-priority navigation paths (e.g., homepage to projects).
    *   Avoid broad "/*" patterns in speculation rules; instead, use a specific list of URLs.
    *   For dynamic routes, selectively opt-in to prefetching with `prefetch={true}` on critical links.

*   **Speculation Rules:**
    *   **Bug Fix:** Add the `data-speculation` attribute when creating speculation rule scripts so that the cleanup function can properly remove them.
    *   **Observer Logic:** Update the `IntersectionObserver` to exclude links with the `data-no-prefetch` attribute.
    *   **Strengthen Rules:** Narrow the scope of `prerender` and `prefetch` rules to be more targeted and reduce unnecessary bandwidth usage.
    *   **Browser Support:** Guard the Speculation Rules block to ensure it only runs in browsers that support it.

*   **View Transitions:**
    *   Wire view transitions to Next.js router events or controlled link clicks instead of the generic `window.addEventListener('navigate', ...)`.
    *   Wrap DOM updates within `document.startViewTransition` for smoother animations.

*   **Google Maps:**
    *   Load the Google Maps API on demand only on pages where it is used, rather than globally.
    *   Use dynamic library import (`google.maps.importLibrary`) or the `js-api-loader`.
    *   Ensure the API key is restricted with an HTTP referrer.

*   **Code Polish:**
    *   Remove the JSDoc `@typedef` for `PreloadConfig` to rely on the TypeScript definition as the single source of truth.
    *   Refactor the main component to split out Analytics, Structured Data, and the Maps loader to reduce the amount of code shipped to every page.

### **SEO/Analytics**

*   **Analytics Scripts:**
    *   Choose between Google Tag Manager (GTM) or the GA4 tag, but do not use both simultaneously to avoid duplicate events and script costs. The recommended approach is to load GTM and deploy the GA4 tag from within GTM.

*   **JSON-LD (Structured Data):**
    *   De-duplicate and restructure the JSON-LD to have a primary `Organization` type.
    *   If a page-level entity is needed, use `WebPage` or `ProfilePage` and link it to the `Organization` using properties like `about` to avoid repeating information.

### **Security and Wallet Integration**

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   Implement a strict CSP to prevent unauthorized scripts, including those used for cryptojacking.
    *   Key directives to include are `default-src 'self'`, `script-src 'self' 'nonce-<nonce>'`, and `worker-src 'none'`.
    *   Use Trusted Types to mitigate DOM-XSS.

*   **Third-Party Scripts:**
    *   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for any scripts loaded from a CDN to ensure their authenticity.

*   **Authentication and Wallet Connection:**
    *   Use EIP-4361 (Sign-In with Ethereum) with nonces for more secure logins.
    *   Implement EIP-6963 for multi-provider discovery to reliably detect installed wallets.
    *   Integrate the MetaMask SDK or WalletConnect to improve the connection experience on mobile devices.
    *   Provide a deep-link fallback for mobile users to open the dApp directly in the MetaMask browser.

### **UI/UX Feedback**

*   **General Usability:**
    *   Reconsider the use of a custom cursor as it can be a "hit or miss" feature for users.
    *   Increase the contrast between the font and the background for better readability.
    *   The homepage should provide a clear overview of who you are and your qualifications.

*   **Navigation and Transitions:**
    *   Fix the navbar tooltips to ensure their states reset correctly.
    *   Make the transitions between tabs less jarring; the large logo animation was noted as lagging and disruptive.
    *   Improve the navigation by making the icons more intuitive, possibly by adding text labels so users don't have to hover to understand them.
    *   Consider alternatives to the bottom sliding menu bar, such as buttons on each side that could open a pop-up or an expanded menu, to make it feel more spacious.

*   **Performance and Content:**
    *   Investigate why the mouse effects slow down after switching between tabs.
    *   For the blog section, consider adding a picture for each post to make it more visually appealing.
