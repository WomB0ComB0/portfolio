## 📊 What Gets Created

The AI automatically:

- ✅ Extracts dates and converts to YYYY-MM-DD
- ✅ Parses technologies into arrays
- ✅ Identifies URLs (company websites, GitHub, etc.)
- ✅ Generates slugs for projects
- ✅ Sets sensible defaults (order: 0, featured: false)
- ✅ Infers categories from technologies
- ✅ Creates properly typed Sanity documents

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem                   | Solution                                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| "Authentication failed"   | Check `SANITY_API_TOKEN` has **Editor** permissions |
| AI returns text, not JSON | Enable `responseFormat: json_object` in AI node     |
| Missing required fields   | Add more detail to your raw text                    |
| Rate limit error          | Add 300ms delay or switch to Anthropic              |

## 🎨 Advanced Tips

### Batch Processing

Edit `rawText` to include multiple items (AI will intelligently separate them):

```
Experience 1: Senior Engineer at Vercel, 2023-Present, React/Next.js

Experience 2: Software Engineer at Meta, 2021-2023, React Native
```

### Custom Schemas

Duplicate an AI Prompt node and adjust the schema in the system prompt for your own content types.

### Web Scraping

Add an **HTTP Request** node before input to fetch LinkedIn/GitHub pages automatically.

2. **List all technologies**: The AI extracts these perfectly
3. **Include URLs**: Company sites, GitHub, live demos
4. **Add context**: The more detail, the better the structure
5. **Review in Sanity**: Always check before publishing
