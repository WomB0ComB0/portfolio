/**
 * @file This script automates the process of running web performance audits using Unlighthouse.
 * It first ensures that Playwright's Chromium browser is installed, then prepares
 * the environment variables by sanitizing `process.env` and injecting the Chromium executable path.
 * Finally, it executes the Unlighthouse command to analyze the configured application URL.
 * The script provides real-time output from the installation and auditing processes.

 * @web This script orchestrates browser automation via Playwright and web performance auditing via Unlighthouse.
 * @throws {Error} If `bunx playwright install chromium` fails, indicating an issue with browser installation.
 * @throws {Error} If `bunx unlighthouse` fails, indicating a problem during the site auditing process.

 * // To execute this script, simply run it with Bun:
