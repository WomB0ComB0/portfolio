/**
 * @file Cleanup Script
 * @module scripts/cleanup
 * @description This script orchestrates the removal of various build artifacts, cache directories, and temporary files
 *              to ensure a clean development environment. It helps in resolving potential issues caused by stale
 *              cache or build data and prepares the project for a fresh build.
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @since  1.0.0
 * @example
 * To run this cleanup script from your project root:
 * ```bash
 * bun scripts/cleanup.ts
 * ```
 * @see {@link https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/exec `bun $` utility documentation} for details on command execution.
 */

import { $ } from 'bun';

/**
 * Executes a series of cleanup tasks to remove build artifacts, cache directories, and other temporary files
 * from the project.
 *
 * This function systematically clears:
 * 1. Next.js build output and cache (`.next` directory).
 * 2. TypeScript build information (`tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` file).
 * 3. Test coverage reports and Vitest cache (`coverage` and `.vitest` directories).
 *
 * Each task's execution status is logged to the console, indicating success or if it was skipped due to an error.
 * Upon completion, it provides helpful next steps for the developer.
 *
 * @public
 * @async
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when all cleanup tasks have been attempted.
 * @throws {Error} Although individual task failures are caught and logged, an unhandled error during
 *                 the execution of the script itself (e.g., critical Bun runtime error) would cause
 *                 this promise to reject.
 * @example
 * // To invoke the cleanup process programmatically (e.g., from another script):
 * await cleanup();
 * @version 1.0.0
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @see {@link module:src/__tests__/type-check.ts The type-check script} for verifying TypeScript types.
 * @see {@link module:src/__tests__/api-manual-test.ts The API manual test script} for testing API endpoints.
